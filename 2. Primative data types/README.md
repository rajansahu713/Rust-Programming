## Primitive Data Types in Rust

Important Point to Remember:
- Rust has a strong and static type system. This means that every variable must have a type, and the type is checked at compile time.
- Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

### Integers
- An sign i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127.
- An unsigned integer u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

### Float 
- By default you are declaring a 64-bit float. You can declare a 32-bit float by using f32.

### Boolean
- Rust has a boolean type that can be either true or false.

### Character
- Rust has a character type that can be any Unicode character.
